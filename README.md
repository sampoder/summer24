# `summer24`

In Year 1, [Healthy Harold](https://lifeed.org.au/about-us/healthy-harold/) made a visit to my primary school:

_(now, yes, that isn't quite Lindfield East Public School but that's besides the point)_

This summer, I want to do a similar thing. Instead of a lesson on healthy living, people would come down to the bus for a hackathon of sorts. 

The first step would be aquiring a vehicle to serve as our "bus". The vehicle would need to be reasonably cheap, have space for three or so people to sleep in it, and have space to store all the materials needed to run a fifty-person hackathons. Ideally, it'd be something like an old Volkswagen Type 2:
