# summer '24 idea

In Year 1, [Healthy Harold](https://lifeed.org.au/about-us/healthy-harold/) made a visit to my primary school:

_(now, yes, that isn't quite Lindfield East Public School but that's besides the point)_

This summer, I want to do a similar thing. Instead of a lesson on healthy living, people would come down to the bus for a hackathon of sorts. 

The first step would be aquiring a vehicle to serve as our "bus". The vehicle would need to be reasonably cheap, have space for three or so people to sleep in it, and have space to store all the materials needed to run a fifty-person hackathons. Ideally, it'd be something like an old Volkswagen Type 2:

Then, a route would need to be determined. There'd be marketing materials to make, 

* Sponsors (lots of fundraising! probs approx. $50k)
  * HCB for bank account I guess
  * Crowdfunding?
* Route
* Marketing -> Local Contacts
  * this is probably the toughest part of this
* Some sort of program for each hackathon?
* Find teammates
  * Who is crazy enough to spend a summer driving around the country?
* Learn how to drive (!!!)
* Bus modifications
* Have a plan for food / not being driven insane
